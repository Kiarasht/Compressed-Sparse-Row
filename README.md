# Compressed-Sparse-Row

Compressed Sparse Row is a general storage format that gets ride of zero values in a matrix by storing nonzero values, 
their indexes, and pointers in three different arrays. This way the space and performance can be substantially
improved except certain cases. Check the [Compressed Sparse Row.pdf](https://github.com/Kiarasht/Compressed-Sparse-Row/blob/master/Compressed%20Sparse%20Row.pdf) file for more info.
